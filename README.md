## What is dikenang?

Dikenang is actually my private project with my girlfriend, moved to a public repository lately. Dikenang is a private social media to shares memories together with the user's linked partnership. Dikenang is like Facebook, Instagram, Quora, or whatever social media that exist, it should do its job to post a picture, video, conversation sound, story, etc, but with extra features that should protect its privacy and uniqueness. see [dikenang.netlify.app](https://dikenang.netlify.app) for experimental preview.
